# Mock API Documentation Site

This repo showcases how to go about creating an API documentation site. This site was created with `create-react-app`.

## Motivation

Many of the API docs out there share common features or design patterns, so this repo is just a way for me to mimick some of those features that I see in the wild. They are the following: 

* highlight section on sidebar on scroll
* scroll to section
* imitation terminal on the webpage
* running an API query on the webpage itself

## Instructions

First you have to run `npm install` to download the dependencies. Then after all the dependencies are downloaded, you can run :

```sh
npm start
```

## Questions

If you have any questions or inquiries, feel free to let me know. But this repo is a work in progress. Don't read too much into it.
